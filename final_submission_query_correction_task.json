Here's the corrected SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT *\nFROM campaigns\nJOIN inventory\nON campaigns.campaign_id = inventory.campaign_id;\n```\n\nHowever, if you indeed wanted to join the `campaigns` table with the `inventory` table using the `stock_status` column, you might have meant to use a subquery or a different relationship between the tables. In this case, there is no direct relationship between the `campaigns` and `inventory` tables based on the provided schema, so I cannot provide an accurate SQL query. Please double-check the relationship between the tables and the column names in your natural language query."
